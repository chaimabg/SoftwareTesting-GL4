# Software Testing
Applying different levels of software tests :

* [Unit testing](https://github.com/chaimabg/SoftwareTesting-GL4/tree/main/unitTest) : Validating that each software unit performs as expected.
* [Integration testing](https://github.com/chaimabg/SoftwareTesting-GL4/tree/main/integrationTest) : Ensuring that software components or functions operate together.
* [System testing](https://github.com/chaimabg/SoftwareTesting-GL4/tree/main/end2end%20Test) :  Testing the entire software product from beginning to end to ensure the application flow behaves as expected
* [Acceptance testing](https://github.com/chaimabg/SoftwareTesting-GL4/tree/main/acceptance%20Test) : Verifying whether the whole system works as intended.
